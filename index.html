                Where else would the adage have come from?<br> 
                Those who have lived with, or observed cats, can attest to the fact that they are not timid by nature. <br>
                They easily approach humans with a meow, a sniff, and a rubbing of their bodies against the person. <br>
    
                When cats are not napping, it is very easy to engage them in some form of active play, with a piece of string or a beam of light. <br>
                They will easily be attracted by the movement and try to paw at or grab it. <br>
                It is also the same curiosity that has often led a cat to rummage through <br>
